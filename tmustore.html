                        the client wanted efficiency, so I focused on everything being simple and straightforward.

                        by me. Sale prices provided. Mimic normal sale flyers with price
                        being the most highlighted. Along with the 2 flyers, a new store hours ad to be printed and published
                        in the TMU newspaper: The Eyeopener. Main focus was to be interesting but also focus the new hours.
                        All were assigned together with different deadlines. </h3>
                    <h3>I started with the November sale. I picked some items, got them approved and made a list of 
                        the new sale prices. I photographed and edited them. I knew there was another sale in January
                        so I decided to make the flyers similar so customers recognized the near monthly sales but still
                        make each distinct so it was noticeable that it was a new flyer for a new sale. My process was the 
                        same for both flyers. I decided on blue for all 3 projects to match the winter
                        season. I decided to have the important elements stand out by having them on a white or light background.
                        I used the complimentary colour to blue as the sale price colour to make them the focus. For the 
                        store hours ad I decided to get a bit more creative to have the ad stand out against all other ads
                        in the newspaper so I decided on making a winter landscape illustration and having the white sky as the
                        backdrop for the information. Once done I proofed it and sent it off to the design and print department of
                        The Eyeopener. All other flyers and ads were printed and published digitally by myself.
